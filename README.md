## STARSHOP v1.0
A Node.js Express application that utilizes the EJS templating engine and seamlessly integrating with Stripe. The platform provides an intuitive interface for users to explore products, order products, and complete transactions with Stripe Checkout. Stripe products are fetched dynamically to showcase on the products page.

Key features include registration, user authentication, allowing only logged-in users to place orders, and a checkout process via Stripe Checkout. Upon successful payment, orders are automatically stored in an order.json file. User data is stored in a users.json file. The application includes an admin section accessed via credentials stored in a .env file.

This project was developed as part of a student project at Medieinstitutet in 2024.
